My name is Tom Rosenzweig, I am an ambitious and aspiring security researcher and analyst. My journey into the field of Cyber-Security and IT began in 2021, and since then, I have been dedicated to developing my skills and expertise in this dynamic and ever-evolving industry.

The purpose of creating this website is to share my documentation and projects, and to create a centralized toolkit by compiling and organizing all the necessary resources in one place, this website serves as a valuable reference point for me to quickly access the tools, techniques, and knowledge I need for my work in the industry. It is my hope that it can also serve as a useful resource for others in the field.
